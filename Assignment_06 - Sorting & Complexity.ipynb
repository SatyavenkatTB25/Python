    "1Q) A simple sorting algorithm is called a \"Bubble Sort\" because elements bubble around through the list. It is also called a \"Sinking Sort\" because the larger values \"sink\" to the end (bottom) of the list. A bubble sort iterates through a list and swaps adjacent pairs if they are in the wrong order. The sort continues until all elements are correctly ordered.\n",

    "You can enhance the basic bubble sort algorithm by optimizing the inner loop. In the basic implementation, the inner loop always iterates through all elements, even when the list is partially sorted. By maintaining a record of whether any swaps occurred in the prior pass, you can streamline the inner loop. If no swaps transpired, it implies the list is already sorted, enabling an early exit from the loop."
